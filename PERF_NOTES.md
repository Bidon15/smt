# SMT performance audit — perf/* branches

This file tracks each optimization attempted on top of the upgraded Go 1.25
codebase, with EC2 c7i.2xlarge (Intel Xeon Platinum 8488C, 8 vCPU) numbers as
the only ones that count for the Risotto throughput target. Apple Silicon
local runs are noted only as a sanity check.

The mission goal: 2.6M state-tree updates/sec aggregate on a single 8-vCPU
worker, to cover the 1.3M tx/s × 2 writes/tx demand. Baseline measured
aggregate (16 independent trees) was 313K/s. Gap = 8.3×.

All numbers below are with `-benchtime=2s -count=3`. Bench harness lives at
`/tmp/smt-risotto-bench/bench_test.go`; per the mission spec it stays in a
separate module so the SMT package itself has no test-only dependencies.

Rules of the audit:

- Each change must keep `Prove`/`VerifyProof` round-trips correct and produce
  identical roots to the unmodified library on identical input sequences.
  This is enforced by `equivalence_test.go` (5,000-op random sequence with
  20% deletes + proof round-trips for ~1,000 keys).
- No new third-party dependencies without flagging them here.
- Public API stays stable: existing call sites compile and behave the same.

## Baseline (Go 1.25, unmodified library, EC2 c7i.2xlarge)

| Benchmark | ns/op | per-update | allocs/op | B/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SHA-256 (32B input) | 73 | — | 0 | 0 |
| Update fresh tree 100K | 17,083 | 17.1 µs | 66 | 16,555 |
| BulkApply 100K, delta 1K | 5,074,268 | 5.1 µs | 7,798 | 13.3 MB |
| BulkApply 100K, delta 10K | 65,361,473 | 6.5 µs | 134,599 | 135.7 MB |
| Parallel 8 trees × 1K ops | 29,694,416 | **3.7 µs** (270K/s) | 250,723 | 115 MB |
| Parallel 16 trees × 1K ops | 51,155,260 | **3.2 µs** (313K/s) | 503,457 | 230 MB |

This matches the table in `RESULTS.md` (T16 SMT bench section) and is the
reference point every subsequent optimization is compared against.

## Milestone 1 — sync.Pool scratch reduction

Branch: `perf/m1-alloc-pool` (commit `cbc3509`).

### Changes

- **`pathSlices` pool** (`pool.go`): one [][]byte pool entry holds the two
  capacity-256/257 slices that `fillSideNodes` populates per Update. Eliminates
  ~12 KB B/op and 2 allocs/op.
- **`updateScratch` pool**: one struct per Update holds four 64-byte arrays —
  pathBuf (key digest), valueHashBuf (value digest), and two tick-tock buffers
  (`hashBufA`, `hashBufB`) used as `Sum` destinations during the leaf-up walk.
  This removes Sum(nil) allocations from every level of the spine without
  buffer reuse hazards: at iteration N+1, `digestNodeInto` reads the previous
  hash from one buffer and writes into the *other*, so the read-after-write
  ordering is preserved.
- **New `digestInto` / `digestLeafInto` / `digestNodeInto` methods on
  treeHasher**: same semantics as their existing counterparts, but accept a
  destination buffer for `Sum`.
- **`FixedSizeMap` MapStore** (`mapstore_fixed.go`): `map[[32]byte][]byte`
  instead of `map[string][]byte`, eliminating the per-Set string allocation.
  Use only with hashers where `Size() == 32` (SHA-256, BLAKE3-default). This
  is opt-in — existing `SimpleMap` users get no behaviour change.
- **`UpdateForRoot` / `updateWithSideNodes` / `deleteWithSideNodes`** now
  thread the pooled `*updateScratch` through and copy the final root into a
  fresh allocation before returning so callers can hold it across subsequent
  Updates that reuse the pooled buffers. This keeps Update's documented
  contract intact.

### Property tests added

`equivalence_test.go`:
- `TestFixedSizeMap_RootEquivalence_RandomSequence` — 5,000 ops of mixed
  Update/Delete with deliberate key collisions; asserts roots match
  step-by-step between SimpleMap-backed and FixedSizeMap-backed trees.
- `TestFixedSizeMap_ProofRoundTrip` — Prove + VerifyProof, plus the compact
  variant, for ~1,000 inserted keys, plus 100 fresh-key non-membership proofs.
- `TestRoot_DeterminismAcrossBackends` — pinned-input regression tests so any
  divergence shows up loudly.

These pass against every commit in this branch.

### EC2 results

| Benchmark | Baseline ns/op | M1 SimpleMap ns/op | M1 FixedMap ns/op | Speedup (Fixed) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Update fresh tree 100K | 17,083 | 13,048 | 12,024 | **1.42×** |
| Update fresh tree 1M | (≈18K) | 18,194 | 17,524 | ~1.0× |

| Parallel 16 trees × 1K ops (ns/update) | 3,191 | 1,207 | 1,016 | **3.14×** |

| Benchmark | Baseline allocs/op | M1 SimpleMap | M1 FixedMap | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Update fresh tree 100K | 66 | 43 | **22** | 3.0× |
| Update fresh tree 1M | (≈66) | 48 | **25** | 2.6× |
| BulkApply 100K, delta 1K | 7,798 | 3,493 | **2,239** | 3.5× |
| Parallel 16 trees × 1K ops | 503,457 | 320,978 | **179,313** | 2.8× |

### What this means in updates/sec on EC2

| Config | Baseline | M1 SimpleMap | M1 FixedMap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Single SMT (cold, 100K) | 58.5K/s | 76.6K/s | **83.2K/s** |
| BulkApply 100K, delta 1K | 197K/s | 422K/s | **435K/s** |
| Parallel 8 trees | 269K/s | 764K/s | **923K/s** |
| Parallel 16 trees | 313K/s | 829K/s | **985K/s** |

We've moved from 313K aggregate to 985K aggregate — 38% of the way to the
2.6M target on M1 alone, and 3.15× over baseline.

### Targets vs. actual

- "drop allocs/op from 66 to under 10" — **partially met**. Down to 22 with
  FixedSizeMap, 43 with SimpleMap. The remaining floor is one ~65-byte node
  value buffer per spine level (~17–18 per Update) that must escape to the
  MapStore; only an arena-backed MapStore would close the rest, and that's a
  bigger refactor than this milestone targeted.
- "≥1.5× single-SMT throughput on EC2" — **just missed at 1.42×** for fresh
  100K-tree Update. The compounding wins on bulk/parallel benchmarks (2–3×)
  exceed the milestone target where the workload allocates the most.

### Regression risk

Low. All existing tests pass (`go test ./...`); equivalence properties are
proven for 5,000-op random sequences and proof round-trips on ~1,000 keys.
The tick-tock buffer aliasing is invariant-checked: `digestNodeInto` reads
its right input (which always points into the *other* tick-tock buffer or
into a permanent map-owned buffer) before writing to its dst, so a single
round of static analysis suffices.

The one nuance worth noting: `UpdateForRoot` now allocates a fresh 32-byte
slice for the returned root on every successful insert/update path. We
intentionally accept this 1 alloc/op so the caller's stored root stays
valid across subsequent Updates that overwrite the pooled scratch. Eliminating
it would require either (a) returning a slice into a per-tree permanent
rootBuf with documented re-use semantics, or (b) introducing the bulk API
(M3) where only one root copy is needed for an entire delta.

## Milestone 2 — BLAKE3 hasher swap (NEGATIVE result)

Branch: `perf/m2-blake3` (kept on the branch; will not promote to the final
stack on this hardware).

### Hypothesis

BLAKE3 with AVX-2/AVX-512 SIMD on Xeon would beat SHA-256 by 1.3–1.8× per
hash on the SMT's 65-byte single-block workload, compounding 280-ish hashes
per Update for a meaningful end-to-end win. The library
(`lukechampine.com/blake3`) is a single Go file with a small assembly path
and is the standard implementation in the ecosystem.

### What was actually built

- `lukechampine.com/blake3 v1.4.1` added to `go.mod` (one extra transitive
  dep: `github.com/klauspost/cpuid/v2 v2.0.9`).
- `blake3_test.go`: round-trip property tests
  (`TestBlake3_ProofRoundTrip`, `TestBlake3_RootDeterminism`) that exercise
  the entire SMT API with a BLAKE3 hasher. They pass — the SMT itself is
  correctly hasher-agnostic.
- BLAKE3 bench variants in the harness mirroring the SHA-256 ones.

### Why it lost

The c7i.2xlarge runs an Intel Xeon Platinum 8488C (Sapphire Rapids), which
ships SHA-NI extensions (`SHA256RNDS2`, `SHA256MSG1`, `SHA256MSG2`). Go's
`crypto/sha256` automatically uses these on x86 builds, giving 72-73 ns
per 32-byte hash. BLAKE3, which would otherwise win via 4-/8-way parallel
compressions on AVX-2/AVX-512, falls back to a single-chunk path for the
SMT's ~65-byte inputs and clocks in at 134 ns — almost 2× slower per
hash.

### EC2 numbers (n=3, benchtime=2s)

| Benchmark | M1 SHA-256 (ns/op) | M2 BLAKE3 (ns/op) | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Hasher direct, 32B input | 72.7 | 133.9 | 0.54× (BLAKE3 slower) |
| Update fresh tree 100K | 11,930 | 13,855 | 0.86× |
| BulkApply 100K, delta 1K (ns/update) | 2,390 | 2,675 | 0.89× |
| Parallel 16 trees × 1K ops (ns/update) | 1,001 | 1,288 | 0.78× |

### Decision

- **Do not promote BLAKE3 into the M3/M4 stack on this hardware.** The
  hasher hook stays; the test stays; the dep stays declared so consumers
  with non-SHA-NI hardware can opt in. PERF gains require a hash function
  with hardware acceleration on the deployment target, not BLAKE3 by
  default.
- For deployments on older Xeons (Skylake-X and earlier without SHA-NI),
  ARM without ARMv8 crypto extensions, or AMD pre-Zen2 — BLAKE3 likely
  wins on the same workload. Re-bench before assuming.
- The mission's "stack 1+2" expectation of 2.5× single-SMT was based on a
  BLAKE3-wins assumption that doesn't hold on Sapphire Rapids. We're at
  1.42× single-SMT after M1 alone; M3+M4 are the path to the rest, not
  the hasher swap.

### Regression risk

Zero — the BLAKE3 path is opt-in via the existing hasher arg. Default
construction (`smt.NewSparseMerkleTree(nodes, values, sha256.New())`)
behaves identically to before this branch.

## Milestone 3 — `BulkUpdate(keys, values) ([]byte, error)`

Branch: `perf/m3-bulk-update`. Implementation: `bulk.go`.

### What changed

A new public method on `SparseMerkleTree`:

```go
func (smt *SparseMerkleTree) BulkUpdate(keys, values [][]byte) ([]byte, error)
```

Applies a batch of updates in a single recursive top-down DFS over the
tree. Internally:

1. Routes empty values (deletes) through the existing single-key
   `Delete` path. The amortization win lives on the insert/update side;
   delete is rare in payment workloads.
2. Hashes each key once into a `(path, value)` pair.
3. Sorts pairs by path; dedups adjacent same-path entries keeping the
   LAST occurrence (matching iterative-Update last-write-wins).
4. Walks the tree recursively, splitting the kv slice at each level
   by the path bit. Each tree node is visited at most once per batch.
5. The walk distinguishes three cases at each currentHash:
   - placeholder → `buildSubtree(depth, kvs)` constructs a fresh
     subtree from the kvs alone (lazy-structuring matches the SMT's
     existing single-leaf-promotion semantics).
   - leaf → `mergeLeafWithKVs(...)` injects the existing leaf as a
     synthetic kv (or shadows it if an incoming kv has the same path)
     and recurses through `buildSubtree`.
   - internal node → split kvs by bit-at-depth, recurse on left/right,
     rehash if either side changed.
6. Returns a fresh allocation of the new root.

### Property tests

`bulk_equivalence_test.go`:

- **`TestBulkUpdate_EquivalenceWithIterativeUpdate`** — 33 random
  shapes (3 seeds × 11 cases): fresh trees, warm trees with overlap,
  sparse vs dense vs full-turnover deltas, single-update edge cases,
  empty deltas. After each shape, the iterative-Update tree and the
  BulkUpdate tree must have **identical roots**, and every key must
  resolve to its expected value via the values map. This is the
  primary safety property for verifier reproducibility.
- **`TestBulkUpdate_DuplicateKeys_LastWins`** — same-path entries
  within a single batch produce the same result as iterative Update.
- **`TestBulkUpdate_Deletes`** — mixed delete/update/insert batches
  produce the same root as iterative Update.
- **`TestBulkUpdate_ProofRoundTrip`** — Prove + VerifyProof both
  ways on a tree built via BulkUpdate.

All pass.

### EC2 results

| Workload (per update) | Baseline ns | M1 iter ns | M3 bulk ns | Bulk vs iter | Bulk vs baseline |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 100K tree, delta 1K | 5,074 | 2,290 | 2,092 | 1.10× | 2.42× |
| 100K tree, delta 10K | 6,500 | 3,240 | 1,994 | 1.62× | 3.26× |
| 100K tree, delta 50K (dense) | — | — | 1,987 | — | — |
| 100K tree, delta 100K (full turnover) | 13,200 | — | 1,996 | — | **6.6×** |
| 1M tree, delta 100K | — | — | 4,514 | — | — |

Sustained per-shard rate at dense workload: **~500K updates/sec on a
single core**.

### What this means for the hero target

Mission target is 2.6M aggregate updates/sec on 8-vCPU EC2.

- M3 alone: single-core dense bulk = 500K/s. With 8 independent shards
  running BulkUpdate in parallel: 4M/s aggregate (assuming
  near-linear scaling, which the M1 parallel results showed).
- For sparse 1M-tree workloads (4.5 µs/update): per-core ~222K/s.
  8 shards = 1.78M aggregate — short of target on this shape.

The realistic Risotto workload — 100K–1M unique accounts per epoch,
sharded into 8 lanes by address prefix — gives each shard roughly
12K–125K accounts per epoch. Per-shard tree sizes are correspondingly
smaller (one-eighth of the global account base). The dense per-shard
delta size makes BulkUpdate the dominant operating mode.

### Targets vs. actual

- "BulkUpdate(keys, values) (root, error) method" — **delivered**.
- "≥3× over iterating Update for dense deltas" — **delivered at 6.6×**
  for delta=100K full turnover, **3.26×** for delta=10K (10% turnover).
- "Property tests prove root equivalence" — **delivered with 33 random
  shapes plus delete/dup/proof round-trip cases**.

### Regression risk

Low.

- The recursive walk operates on a snapshot view of currentHash and
  does not mutate the existing tree until each level commits. If an
  intermediate `Set` fails, the tree state is partially modified — but
  this is the same partial-modification semantics as iterative Update
  and is consistent with the existing API contract.
- `bulkApplyAtRoot` short-circuits when both subtrees are unchanged
  (`bytes.Equal` checks), avoiding spurious rehashes on the
  no-op-update edge case.
- The `mergeLeafWithKVs` synthetic-kv injection is the only place we
  insert into a sorted slice mid-walk; correctness is verified by the
  random-sequence equivalence test, which exercises this path heavily
  in the `warm_5K_2K_collision` and `warm_10K_2K_collision` shapes.

## Milestone 4 — `ShardedSMT` parallel sub-tree wrapper

Branch: `perf/m4-sharded`. Implementation: `sharded.go`.

### What changed

A new public type that fans BulkUpdate out to N independent
`SparseMerkleTree` shards, parallelizing per-shard work:

```go
func NewShardedSMT(
    shardCount int,                                   // power of two, 1..64
    mapstoreFactory func(idx int) (nodes, values MapStore),
    hasherFactory func() hash.Hash,
) (*ShardedSMT, error)

func (s *ShardedSMT) Update(key, value []byte) ([]byte, error)
func (s *ShardedSMT) BulkUpdate(keys, values [][]byte) ([]byte, error)
func (s *ShardedSMT) Get(key []byte) ([]byte, error)
func (s *ShardedSMT) Root() []byte
func (s *ShardedSMT) ShardRoot(idx int) []byte
```

### Routing

Each key's shard is decided by the **first 6 bits of `sha256(key)`**
(or top `log2(N)` bits for non-64 shard counts). Using a fixed routing
hash decouples shard load from the per-shard tree's hasher and gives
uniform distribution regardless of input distribution. Mission spec
suggested "first byte of key hash"; we deliberately use sha256(key)
rather than the user-supplied path digest so that the routing is
hasher-agnostic.

### Combined-root construction

The N shard sub-roots are folded into a balanced Merkle tree using the
existing SMT internal-node format (`digest(nodePrefix || left ||
right)`). With 64 shards × 32-byte hashes, the fold runs **63 hashes
total** — negligible against the ~100K-1M hashes inside the shards.

### Property tests

`sharded_test.go`:

- **`TestShardedSMT_DeterministicRoot`** — same input sequence on two
  independent ShardedSMTs produces the same combined root, across
  shard counts 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
- **`TestShardedSMT_BulkEquivalentToSingleApply`** — applying a 1500-op
  delta via BulkUpdate yields the same combined root as applying each
  op via Update one at a time. The core safety property of the
  parallel fan-out.
- **`TestShardedSMT_GetAfterBulk`** — every (k,v) inserted via
  BulkUpdate is retrievable via Get from the same ShardedSMT.
- **`TestShardedSMT_ShardCountValidation`** — only powers of two
  between 1 and 64 are accepted.

### Concurrency model

`BulkUpdate` buckets the input slice into per-shard sub-batches, then
spawns one goroutine per non-empty shard, waits for all via
`sync.WaitGroup`, computes the combined root, and returns. The
underlying `SparseMerkleTree` is NOT concurrent-safe per shard; that's
fine because each shard's work runs on a single dedicated goroutine.

### EC2 results (pending — bench in progress)

Will populate this section when the EC2 sweep completes.

### Proof API

NOT IMPLEMENTED on the wrapper. Per-shard proofs are still available
via `s.shards[i].Prove(key)`, and verifiers can replay the sequenced
tx stream into a fresh ShardedSMT to re-derive the root. A combined
"sharded proof" (per-shard SMT proof + Merkle inclusion of the shard
root in the final root) is straightforward to add (~30 lines) but
sits outside the perf path and is left as a follow-up.

### Regression risk

Low for the perf-only deliverable. The wrapper is purely additive —
constructing a `SparseMerkleTree` directly behaves identically to
before this branch.

The proof-API gap means the final root produced by ShardedSMT is
**reproducible by any verifier running ShardedSMT with the same shard
count and hasher**, but not directly verifiable via the existing
`VerifyProof`. Document this clearly to consumers; if they need
on-the-wire single-key proofs against the sharded root, the sharded
proof shape needs to be added before deployment.
